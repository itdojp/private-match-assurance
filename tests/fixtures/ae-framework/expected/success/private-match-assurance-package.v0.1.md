ae-framework organizes supplied Evidence; it is not a security proof oracle.

ae-framework is not a certification authority.

Automated satisfaction is not human approval or publication approval.

## Required gates

| tool | status | gate | limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| PMAE-CI-PIPELINE-V0-1 | pass | satisfied | Pass is limited to the stated reviewed check and does not prove Product correctness. |
| PMAE-CONFORMANCE-RUNNER-V0-1 | pass | satisfied | Pass is limited to the stated reviewed check and does not prove Product correctness. |

## Optional gates

| tool | status | gate | limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| PMAE-FORMAL-TOOL-V0-1 | skip | visible-nonblocking | Skipped work is not evidence of successful execution. |
| PMAE-SECURITY-TOOL-V0-1 | unsupported | visible-nonblocking | Unsupported capability is not converted to pass. |
| PMAE-HUMAN-REVIEW-V0-1 | skip | visible-nonblocking | Skipped work is not evidence of successful execution. |

## Judgment and human approval boundary

- automated judgment: `satisfied-with-warnings`
- producer gate judgment: `satisfied`
- native ae judgment: `warning`
- native warning treatment: `visible-nonblocking`
- human approval: `not-applicable-test-only`
- reviewer role: `synthetic-reviewer`
- approval subject: `sha256:908dec7237160a85082d6003882db1d61d8c3835cbc98da6ee38af0a5bd6eda4`
- boundary generated by automation: `True`
- approval decision present: `False`

## Native ae-framework judgment

| claim | native status | required lanes | observed lanes | missing lanes | required Evidence kinds | observed Evidence kinds | missing Evidence kinds | warning codes | policy treatment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| supplied-evidence-contract | warning | behavior, runtime | behavior, runtime |  | integration, runtime-control | integration, runtime-control |  | missing-spec-derived-evidence | visible-nonblocking |

## Limitations

- ae-framework organizes supplied Evidence and is not an oracle of truth.
- This package is neither a security proof nor certification.
- Automated satisfaction is not human approval or publication approval.
- Synthetic fixtures do not establish Product or Protocol correctness.
- No live Product Evidence, private input, or public export is included.
- Native ae-framework warnings remain visible and do not rewrite producer statuses.
- Embedding proves internal producer-to-Assurance consistency but does not independently authenticate producer metadata.
- Producer validation time is a supplied digest-bound assertion, not runner execution time.
- Runner validation is performed but its wall-clock time is not recorded in deterministic output.
